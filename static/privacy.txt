This is a DRAFT that represents my intent, however, the server is currently in development, and may not yet live up to these ideals.


The Crowd Computing web server stores as little data as it can get away with.

Terminology:
- Show: This is Crowd Computing's name for a game of Minecraft that is linked to this web server.  It refers to both the linkage itself and the data stored on this server for the link.  A Minecraft server (includng singleplayer and LAN) may create a Show for each player.  A Show is identified by the Host's last-known Twitch username and a name of the Host's choice, and is available at https://crowd-computing.funnyman3595.com/shows/<username>/<show name>
- Viewer: A user who has connected Twitch to this app.  Viewers can create, view, edit, and delete their Mini Configurations for any Show they have a link to, or for which they already have a Mini Configuration.  They can also become a Host by linking a Show.
- Host: A Viewer who has at least one linked Show.  In addition to what they can do as a Viewer, they can also view, edit and delete their Shows.
- Mini Configuration: The data that tells the Viewer's miniature what to do in the Host's Minecraft world.  Each Mini Configuration belongs to a specific Show.

Cookies (both Viewer and Host):
- csrftoken: Randomly-generated data, used to prevent CSRF attacks.
- sessionid: Randomly-generated data, used to associate you with your server-side data.

Viewer data stored on the server:
- Your randomly-generated session ID.
- OAuth data from Twitch, specifically:
  - Opaque tokens provided by Twitch when you authorize this app, used to obtain and refresh the data below.
  - Your Twitch username, used to identify you.
  - Your numeric Twitch ID, used to keep your data tied to you if your username changes.
- The Mini Configurations created by you in this app, used to configure your miniatures in the Host's Minecraft world.

Host data stored on the server, per Show:
- The name you gave the Show.
- The randomly-generated Show Token, used to authenticate your Minecraft instance.
- The location of each Crowd Source in your world, along with a map image of blocks in range, used to give your viewers an overview of yoour world.
- The name, location, and size of regions defined by you with the Region Wand, used to allow your viewers to create Mini Configurations.


You can delete all of the information about you from this web server by clicking the button at http://crowd-computing.funnyman3595.com/delete

If you have a Mini Configuration for a Show, this data will be sent to the Host's Minecraft world on request, except for the OAuth tokens.  Once the data is sent, it's beyond my control; you'll have to contact the Host if you want to delete it.
