Crowd Computing is a Minecraft mod that allows a streamer's audience to participate in a constructive, controllable fashion.  With the streamer's permission, the audience is able to perform a wide variety of useful tasks, both manual and automated.

The flagship use case of this mod is a streaming pack called Crowdsourced,
which uses it to provide the vast majority of its content.

You probably don't need me to say this, but since I work there, I need to say it
anyway: This is not an officially supported Google product.  Nor is it a Google
product at all.  It's just a personal project of someone who happens to work there.
